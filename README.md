# Summary
My name is Patrick Michael Lannan and I was born in the Good Samaritan Hospital in Brockton. I was born here, and I have lived here ever since. Ever since I was a child barely able to walk, I have had an obsession with baseball. I played it all the time as I grew up, and played baseball video games as well. Sadly after my team won the championship back at West Junior High, I haven't played since. I wanted to come back to it but it just never worked out. I just recently got a job at Sears, and I also try to get to the gym a few times a week, even though I have been slacking off recently. Obviously my favorite sport is Baseball, but I also watch sports. I always make sure I check Patriots, Bruins, and Red Sox games. My absolute favorite thing to do though is play video games. My favorite show is the Eric Andre Show.
# Family 
I grew up in a family of five; my father, mother, brother, and sister. I am the youngest by far as my brother is six years older than me, and my sister is ten years older than me. My dad works at [Sera care]([https://www.seracare.com/](https://www.seracare.com/)) and works with blood, especially infected blood, and contains it/and or ships it. No one has moved out yet, but my brother is working at [Repligen]([https://www.repligen.com/](https://www.repligen.com/)) after graduating at [U Mass Lowell]([https://www.uml.edu/](https://www.uml.edu/)) with a chemical engineering degree. My sister isn't really doing too much.
